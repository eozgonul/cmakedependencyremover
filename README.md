# cmakedependencyremover

Project aims to remove CMake dependencies from CMake generated Visual C++ projects and replace hard coded paths with generics ones to
enable portability between different directories. 

Still at an early stage and please beware before any attempt to use such that some files generated by CMake are deleted permanently.
